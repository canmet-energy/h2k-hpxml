# Resilience CLI Tool

## Objective
Create a command-line interface (CLI) tool that analyzes building resiliency scenarios by examining clothing factors and HVAC performance during power outages and extreme weather conditions.

## Requirements
* The code/cli should be contained in bin/resilence.py and leverage bin/h2k2hpxml.py and h2ktohpxml/h2ktohpxml.py
* Code should be written in python. 
* Code should use the openstudio sdk to articulate the model scenarios as required.
* OpenStudio Python Bindings are installed in the environment. 
* Always check for python bindings before running. 

The CLI should accept the following parameters:

- `h2k_path` (required): Path to H2K XML file
- `outage_days` (optional): Number of days for power outage analysis (default: 7, range: 0-365)
- `output_path` (optional): Output folder path (default: same directory as H2K input file)
- `clothing_factor_summer` (optional): Summer clothing insulation factor (default: 0.5, range: 0.0-2.0)
- `clothing_factor_winter` (optional): Winter clothing insulation factor (default: 1.0, range: 0.0-2.0)
- `run_simulation`(optional): Runs a full annual simulation. (default: False)

  I --> J[End]
```

### 1. Files and Folders Setup
- Create a project folder with the output directory with the same basename as the h2k_path.
- Copy the file at the h2k_path into the project folder as original.h2k
- Create a `original` folder within the project directory

### 1. Convert and run original model.
- Convert H2K file to OSM format using h2khpxml converter
- Save as `original.osm` in the `original` folder
- Run original simulation using OpenStudio with robust error handling.

### 1. Weather File Download
- Using the weather file name, locate matching  EWY weather files using `h2ktohpxml/resources/weather/h2k_weather_names.csv`. 
- Download weather files if not present in `resources/weather/` folder. See if you can use the get_cwec_file function in h2ktohpxml/utils/weather.py . The resources/weather/ folder is where we keep all the weather epw files.
- Validate that the weather file exists or that it was downloaded correctly.  

### 1. Determine hottest period for each weather file. 
- For both weather files:
  - Scan hourly dry-bulb temperatures
  - Identify the hottest consecutive period matching `outage_days` length
  - Store start dates in `extreme_periods.yml`:
    ```yaml
    cwec_outage_start_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    ewy_outage_start_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    ```

### 1. Season Determination
- Analyze both weather files to determine summer/winter periods
- Summer: periods where average daily temperature > 15°C
- Winter: periods where average daily temperature ≤ 15°C
- Store results in `summer_period.yml`:
  ```yaml
  cwec_summer_start: "MM-DD"
  cwec_summer_end: "MM-DD"
  ewy_summer_start: "MM-DD"
  ewy_summer_end: "MM-DD"
  ```

### 1. Scenario Generation
Using OpenStudio Python SDK, create four scenarios based on this matrix:

| run_name                      | weather_file | clothing_schedule | mechanical_cooling_available | power_failure_schedule |
|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| outage_typical_year           | CWEC         | TRUE              | TRUE                         | TRUE                   |
| outage_extreme_year           | EWY          | TRUE              | TRUE                         | TRUE                   |
| thermal_autonomy_typical_year | CWEC         | TRUE              | FALSE                        | FALSE                  |
| thermal_autonomy_extreme_year | EWY          | TRUE              | FALSE                        | FALSE                  |

#### For each scenario:
1. **Weather File**: Apply the specified weather file (CWEC or EWY)
1. **Clothing Schedule**: 
   - Interate through all OS PeopleDefinition objects in the model and remove any ClothingInsulationSchedule
   - Delete any orphan Schedule objects. 
   - Create new 'Seasonal Clothing Schedule' schedule.
   - Set the default value: `clothing_factor_winter`
   - Add a Summer rule: `clothing_factor_summer` (applied during summer period from `summer_period.yml`)
1. **Mechanical Cooling**:
   - When TRUE: Ensure cooling system is present with appropriate capacity
   - When FALSE: Disable all cooling equipment and remove thermostat cooling setpoints if present.  
1. **Power Failure Schedule**:
   - When TRUE: Create schedule that disables all heating, cooling, and fans during the outage period (from `extreme_periods.yml`). This should effect all electrical loads as well. 
   - When FALSE: Normal operation (no power interruption)
1. **Output Variables**:
Add the following OutputVariables to the model. Ensure the reporting frequency is hourly.  
    - 'Site Outdoor Air Relative Humidity'
    - 'Zone Air Temperature'
    - 'Zone Air Relative Humidity'
    - 'Zone Mean Radiant Temperature'
    - 'Zone Operative Temperature'
    - 'Zone People Occupant Count'
1. **Output**: Save each OSM model in a subfolder named after the `run_name`

### 5. Optionally Run the Simulations
If run_simulation is True, simulate the models in their folders. 
- Run a full annual simulation
- Use the correct weather file associated for each simulation run (CWEC for typical, EWY for extreme)
- Use proper error handling. Log all std output and std error output to log.txt in the run_name folder
- Ensure that the eplusout.sql file was created. Otherwise log a failure to the log.txt file
- Ensure that the eplusout.err does not contain fatal or severe errors, otherwise log the error in the log.txt
- Ensure that the hourly output variables requested are present in the eplusout.sql file
  - Queries ReportVariableDataDictionary table in eplusout.sql
  - Verifies all required variables: 'Zone Air Temperature', 'Zone Mean Radiant Temperature', etc.
  - Confirms hourly reporting frequency for each variable
  - Logs success/failure of validation to log.txt 


## Error Handling Requirements
- Validate all input parameters and file paths
- Provide clear error messages for missing weather files
- Handle OpenStudio simulation failures gracefully
- Verify weather file data integrity before processing

- Implement robust file I/O with proper exception handling
- Ensure weather file downloads are properly cached
- Validate that required dependencies (h2khpxml, OpenStudio) are available
- Use pytest framework for test organization and execution
- Implement proper test isolation to avoid side effects between tests
- If OpenStudio-HPXML is unavailable inform user and exit with an error code, do not continue.

- **Solution**: Fixed to use proper OpenStudio Python bindings syntax
- **Impact**: Enables proper optional object checking and model manipulation

#### 2. HPXML-OSM Workflow Integration  
- **Challenge**: Direct Python HPXML translation not available in OpenStudio bindings
- **Solution**: Integrated OpenStudio-HPXML Ruby workflow via subprocess calls
- **Validation**: Checks OpenStudio-HPXML availability before starting any workflow
- **Error Handling**: Exits with clear error message if OpenStudio-HPXML unavailable
- **Result**: Real building geometry and systems from H2K files (no fallback)

#### 3. Project Structure Enhancement

- **File Preservation**: Copies original H2K file to `original.h2k` in project folder root
- **Consistent Naming**: Changed from `baseline/` to `original/` folder structure
- **Scalable Design**: Multiple H2K files can be processed without output conflicts

#### 4. Weather File Architecture Enhancement
- **Integration**: Now uses existing `get_cwec_file()` function from `h2ktohpxml.utils.weather`
- **Proper Storage**: Weather files stored in `h2ktohpxml/resources/weather/` directory
- **Enhanced Validation**: Validates weather file existence after download/extraction
- **Dual Processing**: Separate analysis of CWEC and EWY weather files
- **Location Mapping**: Enhanced H2K location extraction and CSV matching

#### 5. Season Determination Algorithm Enhancement
- **Initial Issue**: Summer period incorrectly detected as only 2 days
- **Root Cause**: Algorithm stopped at first temperature drop, ignoring normal fluctuations
- **Solution**: Robust multi-step algorithm:
  1. **Consecutive Period Detection**: Find all periods ≥7 consecutive days >15°C
  2. **Longest Period Selection**: Choose longest qualifying period as summer
  3. **Fallback Logic**: Use meteorological summer if no clear temperature-based period
  4. **Fluctuation Handling**: Handles normal temperature variations within summer
- **Result**: Realistic summer period detection (79-day periods for Ottawa)

#### 6. Simulation Execution and Validation
- **Challenge**: Complete EnergyPlus simulation workflow with error handling
- **Solution**: Multi-step simulation process:
  1. **OSM to IDF Conversion**: Using OpenStudio ForwardTranslator
  2. **EnergyPlus Execution**: With proper weather file assignment
  3. **Error Monitoring**: Parse eplusout.err for fatal/severe errors  
  4. **Output Validation**: Verify required variables in eplusout.sql

- Graceful error handling with clear exit codes for missing dependencies

### Known Limitations (Minor)

1. **EWY Weather Files**: Currently using CWEC files as EWY placeholders (easily updated when real EWY files available)
2. **OpenStudio-HPXML Required**: Tool requires OpenStudio-HPXML installation; exits with error if unavailable

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Enhanced Comfort Analysis**: Add Fanger PMV/PPD calculations when people objects present
2. **Results Post-Processing**: Automated analysis of resilience metrics from simulation outputs  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel simulation execution for multiple scenarios
