# Development tasks todo

- Pre check to make sure the h2k file is valid (see if results section is present?)


- Update emission factors and fuel costs
- FSA lookup for suburban vs rural building site
- MURB functionality (must ensure that HPXML can handle both types)
- Account for LED lighting fractions to change LightingType
- Atypical electical loads
- Check for anything in h2k that would go under "Fuel Loads"
- Error handling if R-value is ever 0
- Ensure that "attic - vented" vs "unvented" aligns with HVAC distribution system inputs
- Update annual results checker to work with h2k files in general mode
- Check if something is happening with window R-value assumptions in the HPXML workflow ( is it making assumptions about the frame, when those are already built-in to h2k?)
